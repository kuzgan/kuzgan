# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Programming has been my passion for 7 years.
I took my first steps by writing simple console applications in C++, which allowed me to understand programming. Later, I dealt with technologies such as C#, C, JavaScript, PHP, MsSQL, CSS, and HTML.

After a short break from programming in which I developed another passion related to road transport, logistics, and car mechanics, I started learning JavaScript.
I chose the frontend path to see the effects of my work in a browser window and not in the console. For some time now, my goal has been to become a professional, I learned on my own technologies such as React, Redux, and JavaScript.

For the 3 last months I have worked with such technologies as JavaScript, TypeScript, React, HTML5, CSS3 and I have created responsive websites.
